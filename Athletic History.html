<p>Ever since I was a child I have been passionate about sports. Being able to grow up over the past 20 years as a Boston sports fan has been a blessing as I have been able to watch every Boston team win at least one championship.</p> 
<p><b>Early years:</b></p>
<p>As a child I had many opportunity to compete in many different sports. My father got me into playing hockey, soccer and baseball when I was just 4 years old. It wasnt until the forth grade when I had found my favorite sport in lacrosse.</p>

<p><b>High School Years:</b></p>
<p>Throughout the years of trying all different kinds of sports I was able to narrow my two favorite sports to hockey and lacrosse. For both I played at the varsity level for all four year</p>

<p>Even now I still keep myslef busy by playing on the UMaine club lacrosse team. We started of the 2018 fall season undefeated and look to carry that momentum into the 2019 spring season. I also enjoy participating in the fraternity intramural leagues.</p>
